# Spring: Spring MVC

## Overview

Welcome to one of my practice repositories where I study and share my findings about Spring Boot and Spring MVC. The base code of this repo is from a LinkedIn Learning course titled [Spring: Spring MVC](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/spring-spring-mvc-2/spring-mvc-for-robust-applications?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5b101b04498e06fb6e2d8785&resume=false&u=78163626). The author of the course is Ketkee Aryamane. 

Part of my studies involves following online tutorials and courses, that I think I will find useful to learn from. 
I find these kind of study materials useful, especially when it involves some new programming frameworks like Spring. 
Before I jump into building bigger projects, I always like to go over easier demos to get a better feeling of what the framework is offering. 
Ketkee Aryamane's course is a great example of that kind of educational content. It offers a great overview of Spring MVC. For this course she prepared a great demo project that is helpful when trying to learn what are the building block of a Spring MVC web application. 
You can read my full review of the Spring: Spring MVC here on my [blog](https://medium.com/@gregoryszy/introduction-3d69f1278f84) on Medium. 

Over time I like to come back to these examples and do additional modifications. You will also see a lot of additional comments over the code. That is my way of taking notes, so I can solidify my understanding about what a specific line of code does and how does it relate to the whole project. Spring MVC has a lot to offer so I will treat this repository  as a playground where I can test new and old Spring MVC features, learn more about how to properly use Github and practice my writing skills. 

## Key Topics

Below are the topics that I have learned from following the Spring: Spring MVC course and reviewing it's coding examples. Whenever I make such lists I like to add questions that I think the course helps to answer:
